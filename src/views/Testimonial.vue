          The item is in a great quality and is shipped in the wonderful
          presentation box. The little brooches are needed to be removed before
          washing. As far as softness goes, IMHO, Iâ€™ve seen softer ones. I would
          definitely would by again if they had different color patterns. Not
          everyone is so big on pastel pink.
